.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
library is a library interface which provides
a space-efficient binary diff and patch functionality
for use by programs and scripts.
The typical space usage is about half of xdelta version 1.
.Pp
A
.Dv delta_t
structure is opaque, and is initialised
using the
.Fn delta_new
function, and all resources freed
with the
.Fn delta_free
function.
.Pp
Memory can be
.Dq diffed
to produce a patch using the
.Fn delta_diff_mem
function,
and the resulting diff can be re-applied to the original file
to produce the
.Dq new
file using the
.Fn delta_patch_mem
function.
.Pp
There is a similar set of operations at a file level, using the
.Fn delta_diff_file
and 
.Fn delta_patch_file
functions.
.Pp
The two functions
.Fn delta_read_patch_file
and
.Fn delta_write_patch_file
can be used to read and write patch files from memory operations
which have completed successfully.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
library first appeared in
.Nx 8.0 .
